# CPP_IntBitVector
  Assignment in which using a native integer in C++ use bit-wise operations in order to store integers in a single int variable and extract them and compare stored values with another for union operations.

Actually A Super Interesting Challenge That Taught Me A Lot. It Really Made Me Realize How Abstract A Native Data Type Usually Is And How Logistical Semantics Can Give Us Nuanced Procedures In Ways Of Representing Data Relationships.

**The Breakdown:**

  This Program Uses C++ And The Terminal To Display Bit-Wise Operations And Functionality Of Integers To Store Integers Within Them Using Semantics.

  The Program Starts By Requesting From User Integer Values In WHich To Store In A Given 16-Bit Integer. This Is Done For Two Integers And Using A Specified Set Of Bit-Wise Operations We Can Bit-Shift The Given Value Inside Of This Given Integer. 

  By Using The Inverse Of The Entry Bit-Wise Operation We Are Able To Take Out Values As Well From The List.

  As Well As This, We Are Also Gonna Show The Intersection, Union, As Well As Difference Between The Two Stored Integers. 

  All This Is To Thoroughly Go Through Bit-Wise Operations And Actually What Data Looks Like Under The Hood And Some Similarities In Data We Can Get By Knowing Deep Down Data Will Be A Series Of Bits.

  This Program Gave Me A Great Challenge And Made Me Learn A Lot About Data Representation And The Benefits Of Bit-Wise Operations (As Well As Their Cons If Improperly Understood).
